# constitution

This repo contains the working draft for the UNHM Programming Club Constitution.

Some of the undecided aspects will be presented as options so we can determine what to actually ratify and do so sooner.

If you have a different view of how some aspect of the Constitution should be written, make a pull request adding your option under the appropriate section.

Or, get in touch on the Discord.
